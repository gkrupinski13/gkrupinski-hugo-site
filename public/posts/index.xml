      <description>Krupinski&amp;rsquo;s first novel, published by Crowsnest Books. You can purchase a copy here: https://www.crowsnestbooks.com/product/puerto-montt/
Description:
&amp;ldquo;This is a book about reading. Not about writing. Writing doesn’t matter and the people who write matter even less. Or so this writer’s story goes.
Puerto Montt looks at literature as a dangerous calling, in a world where reading is at the centre of both life and community and is not pushed to the outskirts.
Rainer Kinrazip, our guide through these pages, takes the reader on a journey across time and space, from Santiago to Buenos Aires, from the present to the past and even through literature itself.</description>
